<p align="left">Hide Nicks Players (HNP) - allows you to hides the nicks of all players and display them in the actionbar when you click RMB on player.</p>

<h3>❗ The most important difference that distinguishes us from other plugins for hiding nicknames, is the complete absence of any commands to hide them, aslong fixed the bug for semi-transparent invisibility when using the invisibility potion.<h3>
